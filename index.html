        <p>Arizona is a western state in the United States. It shares a border with California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, as well as the country of Mexico. Arizona is a desert which leaves many parts of the state with mild winters and no snow. Although the summer temperatures are brutal, the rest of the year it is a very nice place to be.   </p>
